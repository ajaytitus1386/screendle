## Summary
Implemented core game features to make Screendle playable:

1. **Daily Puzzle System** - Uses seeded random based on date to select from curated list of ~115 popular movies. Everyone gets the same movie each day.

2. **localStorage Persistence** - Game state saves automatically after each guess. Survives page refresh. Clears when date changes.

3. **Bug Fixes**:
   - IMDb rating now requires exact match (was ±0.5 tolerance causing false greens)
   - Search dropdown now works with trackpad taps and mobile touches
   - Genres/keywords are expandable when >3 items (click to show all)
   - Added "Accumulated Clues" bar showing narrowed-down constraints (year range, runtime range, possible genres, etc.)

### Known Issue
- Intermittent ECONNRESET errors to TMDB API (network-level issue, not code)
