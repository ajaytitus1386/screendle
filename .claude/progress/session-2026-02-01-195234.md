## Summary
Planning session: Designed the new Scales game mode. Made key decisions on rating source (IMDb only for MVP), difficulty ramp (easy→hard over 10 rounds), scoring (right/wrong tally out of 10), display (poster + title), synced daily pairs, and instant reveal after each pick. Analyzed combined vs single rating source approaches and decided on IMDb with future option to select RT/Metacritic. Updated CLAUDE.md with all decisions and remaining open items. Percentile stats deferred to Phase 2 (needs backend).
